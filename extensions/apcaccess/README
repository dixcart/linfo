This lets you view the command output of the APC program apcaccess.

Make sure that you have your UPS connected correctly, the apc package installed, and that
running apcaccess produces output you find interesting enough for Linfo to display.

Installation: 
 - Copy/move the class.ext.apcaccess.php into the lib/ folder
 - The following lines must be added to your config.inc.php:
   $settings['extensions']['apcaccess'] = true;
