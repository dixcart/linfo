This implements a ipmi status checker for temps/voltages

Installation: 
 - Copy/move the class.ext.ipmi.php into the lib/ folder
 - The following lines must be added to your config.inc.php:
   $settings['extensions']['ipmi'] = true; 
 - The ipmitool command most likely needs to be run as root, so, 
   if you don't have php running as root, configure sudo appropriately
   for the user the php scripts are running as and add 'ipmitool' to the
   $settings['sudo_apps'] array in config.inc.php
