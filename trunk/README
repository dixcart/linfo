Linfo - PHP server health/information script

Goals: 
 - Provide info such as disk space, temperatures, cpu, ram, etc
 - Be very fast; generation in under a second is most desired.
 - Call very few external programs (like df/load/uptime/etc), if any. (parse the file system for info)
 - Linux version not use external programs *at all* and rely exclusively on /proc and /sys and connecting to locally listening daemons

Global System requirements: 
 - Probably at least PHP 5
 - To display temps/voltages: mbmon and/or hddtemp must be running as a daemon

Linux system requirements:
 - /proc and /sys mounted appropriately
 - Somewhat recent kernel version

FreeBSD system requirements:
 - PHP able to execute usual programs under /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, etc
 - Known to work under 8.0-RELEASE; older versions may work, I'm not sure

Installation:
 - Extract tarball contents to somewhere under your web root
 - Optionally change settings in sample.config.inc.php, then rename it to config.inc.php

Known issues:
 - Getting Linux device names is slow on old systems
 - Linux WIFI is not quite finished
 - FreeBSD support is not quite finished
 - OSX/Win/OtherBSD support does not yet exist
