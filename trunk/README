Linfo - PHP server health/information script

Goals: 
 - Provide info such as disk space, temperatures, cpu, ram, etc
 - Use very, very few external programs (like df/load/uptime/etc), if any. (parse the file system for info)

Global System requirements: 
 - Probably at least PHP 5
 - To display temps/voltages: mbmon and/or hddtemp must be running as a daemon

Linux system requirements:
 - /proc and /sys mounted appropriately
 - Somewhat recent kernel version

FreeBSD system requirements:
 - PHP able to execute usual programs under /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, etc

Installation:
 - Extract tarball contents to somewhere under your web root
 - Optionally change settings in sample.config.inc.php, then rename it to config.inc.php

Known issues:
 - Getting device names is very, very slow on older machines
 - Linux support is mostly done; FreeBSD support is extremely alpha
