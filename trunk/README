Linfo - PHP server health/information script

Etymology:
 - The name 'Linfo' was decided upon before I intended it to be cross platform.
   It was originally only going to be for Linux, and hence I called it Linux-Info,
   and Linfo sounded really catchy. It stuck.

Goals: 
 - Provide info such as disk space, temperatures, cpu, ram, etc
 - Be very fast; generation in under a second is most desired.
 - Call very few external programs (like df/load/uptime/etc), if any. (parse the file system for info)
 - Linux version not use external programs *at all* and rely exclusively on /proc and /sys and connecting to locally listening daemons
 - Don't go nuts with eye candy. Don't use ajax. Make viewing the info on text only browsers possible and easy.
 - Any javascript ever used must be *extremely* subtle and degrade gracefully
 - Don't bother finding Linux distro since it's irrelevant; the kernel and other specs are what matters most
 - Don't give info that can be exploited and turned into a security risk, especially
   not names and command line arguments given to running programs.
 - Don't use blatantly slow methods such as preg_split()

Global System requirements: 
 - At least PHP 5
 - Access to php's preg library, specifically preg_match() and preg_match_all(). You most likely already have this.

Linux system requirements:
 - /proc and /sys mounted appropriately
 - Tested with the 2.6 series of kernels. I'm not sure if it works with older ones.

FreeBSD system requirements:
 - PHP able to execute usual programs under /bin, /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, etc
 - Known to work under 8.0-RELEASE; older versions may work, I'm not sure

Installation/usage:
 1) Extract tarball contents to somewhere under your web root
 2) Rename sample.config.inc.php to config.inc.php, after optionally changing values in it
 3) Visit page in web browser
 4) ???
 5) Profit!

Known issues:
 - Getting Linux device names is slow on old systems
 - Getting Linux device names does not work on all distros [yet]
 - Linux Wifi is not finished
 - OSX/Win/OtherBSD support does not yet exist

Linux system temps/voltages/etc requirments:
 - Have hddtemp listening or periodically writing to syslog, and/or
 - Have mbmon listening, and/or
 - Have sensord periodically writing to syslog and/or
 - Have hwmon set up in /sys. This is enabled by default and works by default at least on recent ubuntu versions
