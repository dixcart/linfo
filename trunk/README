Linfo - PHP server health/information script

Goals: 
 - Provide info such as disk space, temperatures, cpu, ram, etc
 - Use very, very few external programs (like df/load/uptime/etc), if any. (parse the file system for info)

System requirements: 
 - A somewhat modern Linux system with /proc and /sys mounted
 - Probably at least PHP 5
 - To display temps/voltages: mbmon and/or hddtemp must be running as a daemon

Installation:
 - Extract tarball contents to somewhere under your web root
 - Optionally change settings in sample.config.inc.php, then rename it to config.inc.php

Known issues:
 - Getting device names is very, very slow on older machines
